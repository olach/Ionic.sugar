## Features

## Todo
- [ ] JavaScript autocompletions

## Installation
1. Download and extract the zip
2. Rename folder to Ionic.sugar
3. Double click the Ionic.sugar file to install it

Since Ionic uses [Angular](http://angularjs.org/), it is recommended that you also install the [Angular sugar](https://github.com/olach/Angular.sugar) to get autocompletion for Angular directives.
