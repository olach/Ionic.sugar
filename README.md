# Ionic.sugar for Espresso
This is a plugin for MacRabbit's [Espresso](http://macrabbit.com/espresso/) code editor with basic support for [Ionic Framework v1](http://ionicframework.com/).

## Features
This Espresso plugin adds autocompletion of core Ionic (v1) directives, such as `ion-content` and `ion-list`.

## Todo
- [ ] JavaScript autocompletions

## Installation
1. Download and extract the zip
2. Double click the Ionic.sugar file to install it

Since Ionic uses [Angular](http://angularjs.org/), it is recommended that you also install the [Angular sugar](https://github.com/olach/espresso-sugar-angular) to get autocompletion for Angular directives.
